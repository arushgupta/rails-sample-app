    <div class = "overview-letter-body">
	<p class = "overview-letter-body-p">Welcome to the eleventh session of Triton Model United Nations, Spring 2015. This year&#39;s conference will be hosted at Price Center on the University of California, San Diego campus from Saturday, April 25th to Sunday, April 26th, 2015.</p>

	<p class = "overview-letter-body-p">Our conference has grown rapidly in previous years, so we are excited to announce the expansion of committees to a total of twelve. Along with our General Assembly and specialized committees, we are eagerly anticipating a European Union committee and the return of our fast-paced joint crisis committees. The aim of these committees is to foster diplomacy among delegates by blending a diversity of ideas into comprehensive and farsighted solutions. These solutions will be reached through tactful debate by molding idealistic goals into realistic strategies.</p>

	<p class = "overview-letter-body-p">Our Chairs are looking forward to discussing the complexities of international issues, with emphasis on excellence in research, critical analysis and creative problem solving. We will be hosting a guest speaker in each committee who specializes in the topic to offer delegates their realm of experience when evaluating the multifaceted nature of their topics. The guest speakers range from activists in San Diego&rsquo;s United Nations Association, to distinguished researchers and internationally focused professionals.</p>

	<p class = "overview-letter-body-p">The Model United Nations at UC San Diego is pleased to announce the 12th iteration of Triton Model United Nations, to be held at UCSDÂ´s Price Center.
     Following the tradition of the fall conference, TritonMUN XII will have fast paced, tight-knit committees that foster debate and diplomacy. Welcoming delegates of all experience levels, TritonMUN XII will provide delegates with an engaging experience where they can build their negotiation, research, and writing skills.</p>

    <p class = "overview-letter-body-p">The purpose of participating in Model United Nations is promoting United Nations culture and fostering interest in the complexities and nuances of International Relations and Global Policy. In the spirit of this principle we are having an array of committees that explore a series of current events and global issues of interest to the development of an expanding global society. A committee that deals with the incredibly controversial issue of the proliferation of nuclear energy in developing nations, and the very important question of how to manage nuclear waste. The issue of asymmetrical warfare and how it has changed the relations between armed forces and security agencies all over the world. As we approach the 70th session of the General Assembly and the creation of new Sustainable Development Goals Post-2015 MDGs, we are going to have committees that deal with issues of Human Development such as the extension of public health infrastructure, and the issue of sustainable urban growth. In the area of our specialized agencies we will have the Security Council addressing the crisis in the Central African Republic; the Council of Finance Ministers of the European Union addressing the ongoing currency crisis of the Euro, and finally in our crisis committee we will have a historical examination of the 1952 Korean Peninsula war through the eyes of the ROK government and the commanders of the United Nations police mission.</p>
